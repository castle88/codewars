// In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

//     years divisible by 4 are leap years
//     but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
//     but years divisible by 400 are leap years

// Additional Notes:

//     Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them

// Examples can be found in the test fixture.
